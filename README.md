# simple-node-cli-app

This is a simple 'How to Build a CRUD Command Line App with Node.js' project, built out from a FreeCodeCamp tutorial.

The 'node_modules' folder is not included (this can be easily generated by Node), and neither is a 'src' folder (or similar) because of practicality.

TODO: Allow deletion of multiple records (at once) by user ID.
